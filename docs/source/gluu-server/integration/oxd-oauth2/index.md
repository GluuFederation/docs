# oxd OAuth 2.0 for Server-Side Web Apps

## Overview 
Gluu offers OAuth 2.0 client software called [oxd](https://oxd.gluu.org) to simplify the process of securing and integrating **server-side web applications** with the Gluu Server. 

!!! Note 
    If you need to secure and integrate other types of applications, like single-page apps (SPAs) or native apps, navigate back to the [introduction doc](../index.md) to review all supported client software projects. 

## oxd API 
The oxd server supports the OpenID Connect and UMA profiles of OAuth 2.0. OpenID Connect can be used to send a user for authentication and gather identity information about the user. UMA can be used to manage what digital resources the user should have access to.
