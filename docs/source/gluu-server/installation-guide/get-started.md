# Getting Started with the Gluu Server Community Edition

## Overview

There are two main ways to install a Community Edition deployment, one suitable for [testing out capabilities](#install-a-test-deployment) and one suitable for [production](#install-a-production-ready-deployment). This document will help direct you through the appropriate installation process.

## Install a test deployment

1. Set up a virtual machine with the same [minimum requirements](./index.md#system-requirements) as a production deployment.
1. Follow the [Test Drive installation guide](./test-drive.md)

## Install a production-ready deployment

1. [Set up the server or virtual machine](./index.md)
1. Follow in the installation guide for the operating system in use:
    - [Ubuntu 16 or 18](./install-ubuntu.md)
    - [CentOS 7](./install-centos.md)
    - [RHEL 7](./install-rhel.md)
    - [Debian 9](./install-debian.md)
1. Run the [setup script](./setup_py.md)
