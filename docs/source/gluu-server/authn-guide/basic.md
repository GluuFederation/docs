# Authentication against LDAP (a.k.a “Basic” or “Internal”)

## Overview
The 'Basic' or 'Internal' method is used to implement username / password authentication.

Basic authentication relies on a successful LDAP BIND operation against an LDAP directory--either the
local LDAP included in the Gluu Server, or a backend LDAP server like Active Directory that has been configured for
use with the Gluu Server via [Cache Refresh](../user-management/ldap-sync.md).

## Prerequisites

 - Installed Gluu Server
 - [Basic authentication script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/master/Server/integrations/basic/BasicExternalAuthenticator.py)
 - If remote LDAP / AD server then
   - Network connectivity between Gluu Server and backend AD/LDAP
   - Remote Active Directory / LDAP bind information. 
   - Successful completion of Cache Refresh
   
## Properties
The script has the following properties: 

|	Property	|	Description		|	Example	|
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|
|Name		|Name of the authentication module		|basic|
|SAML ACRs | Name of the associated [`AuthnContextClassRef`](../admin-guide/saml/#enable-authncontextclassref-in-oxtrust) value |urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:Password|
|Description		|Description of the purpose of this script|Basic AuthN Script|
|Programming Language|Script Developed with Python|Python|
|Location type|Where this script is located inside Gluu Server|Ldap|
|Usage type|Purpose of usage|Native|
|Custom property|Customization properties|Not required by default|
|Script|The main python script|No change required by default|


## Enable 'Basic' Authentication

Basic authentication should be enabled out-of-the-box. In case it needs to be re-enabled, follow these steps: 

 1. Navigate to `Configuration` > `Person Authentication Scripts`
 1. Expand `basic` 
 1. Check the box to `Enabled` the script
   - You can tail `oxauth_script.log` to check successful initialization of this script
```
GLUU.[root@gluu logs]# tail -f oxauth_script.log
2018-01-10 10:39:16,847 INFO  [oxAuthScheduler_Worker-5] [org.gluu.service.PythonService$PythonLoggerOutputStream] (PythonService.java:209) - Basic. Initialization
2018-01-10 10:39:16,853 INFO  [oxAuthScheduler_Worker-5] [org.gluu.service.PythonService$PythonLoggerOutputStream] (PythonService.java:209) - Basic. Initialized successfully
```
 
### Backend AD/LDAP 
If a backend AD or LDAP is being used to store passwords and authenticate users, navigate to: `Configuration` > `Manage authentication` > `Manage LDAP Authentication` and provide information on the backend directory, including bindDN, bindDN user password, Primary Key ( don't change local primary_key ), Server Name / IP along with port and BaseDN/s. 

A more detailed description of each field can be found in the [Manage Authentication](../admin-guide/oxtrust-ui.md#manage-authentication) section of the Gluu docs.

## Make 'Basic' the Default

By default, basic authentication is the default authentication method for the Gluu Server. In case it needs to be reset, follow these steps:
 
1. Navigate to `Configuration` > `Manage Authentication` >  `Default Authentication Method`
1. Select 'basic' for 'Default acr' and / or 'oxTrust acr' 
 
## Using Basic Authentication

Open up a new browser or incognito window, try to login into your Gluu Server or perform SSO with an SP or RP. 

### Configuring Basic Authentication

To switch the basic authentication method between username and email address, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to `Configuration` > `Manage Authentication`
1. Change the `Local Primary Key` to `uid` for username or `mail` for email address.

Other LDAP configuration settings can be found in the [oxTrust documentation](../admin-guide/oxtrust-ui/#manage-authentication)

### Password reset in local Gluu LDAP

If passwords are stored locally, Gluu admins can reset a user's password in two ways: 

1. Using oxTrust:    
   - Navigate to `Users`> `Manage People`
   - Find the target user
   - Click the `Update Password` button at the bottom of the user record
   - Set the new password      

1. Using LDAP:    
   - Access the local LDAP following [these instructions](https://gluu.org/docs/ce/user-management/local-user-management/#manage-users-in-gluu-ldap)     
   - Search for user with 'uid' or 'mail' attribute    
   - Password attribute ( userPassword ) can be changed using ldapmodify commands      

### Password reset in Remote Backend Server

It's possible to reset a user's password in a Remote Backend Server, but requires configuration of a [different Authentication module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/master/Server/integrations/basic.change_password/BasicPassowrdUpdateExternalAuthenticator.py).
