# User Managed Access 2.0 ("UMA 2") Authorization Server (AS)

## Overview

As a profile of OAuth 2.0 that is complementary to OpenID Connect, UMA 2 defines RESTful, 
JSON-based, standardized flows and constructs for coordinating the protection of APIs and 
web resources.

UMA 2 defines interfaces between authorization servers (AS), like Gluu, and resource servers (RS) that enable centralized policy decision-making for improved service delivery, auditing, policy administration, and accountability, even in a very loosely coupled "public API" environment. 

UMA 2 does not standardize a policy expression language, enabling flexibility in 
policy expression and evaluation through XACML, other declarative policy languages, 
or procedural code as warranted by conditions. 

UMA 2 inherits authentication agnosticism from OAuth. It concentrates on authorization, not authentication. 
It has been profiled to work with OpenID Connect to gather identity claims from whoever is attempting access, 
and enables attribute-based ("claims" in OAuth2) authorization (with group-based or role-based policies a natural subset).
 
## Terminology

UMA 2 introduces new terms and enhancements of OAuth term definitions. A few important terms include:

Resource Owner (RO): An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource--the "user" in User-Managed Access. This is typically an end-user, but it can also be non-human entity that is treated as a person for limited legal purposes, such as a corporation.

Resource Server (RS): A server that hosts resources on a resource owner's behalf, registers resources for protection at an authorization server, and is capable of accepting and responding to requests for protected resources.

Authorization Server (AS)_*_: A server that protects, on a resource owner's behalf, resources managed at a resource server.

_*_ _Gluu acts as an UMA AS_.

Learn more in the UMA 2 [Core](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/uma-core-2.0-20.html), [Federated Authorization](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/ed/oauth-uma-federated-authz-2.0-07.html) and [Grant](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/ed/oauth-uma-grant-2.0-06.html) specifications.

## Scopes

UMA 2 scopes are used to grant a client permission to do an action on a protected resource. Different scopes can grant access to the same action. For example, a "read" action can be allowed with scope "read" or "all". 

For some actions the Resource Server (RS) may want multiple scopes at the same time. For instance, a "read" action should only be allowed if the authorization request includes the "read" **and** "all" scopes. UMA 2 scopes are bound to resources and are used to fetch policies that check whether the specified user or client should have access to the resource. 

The scopes are described in JSON and have the following properties:

- name
- icon\_uri

An example of the scope JSON is given below:

```
{
  "name": "Add photo",
  "icon_uri": "https://<hostname>/icons/add_photo_scope.png"
}
```

!!! Note
    The scope JSON may contain custom properties.

The following is an example what an UMA 2 Scope URL may look like:

```
https://<hostname>/uma/scopes/view
```

!!! Note
    The scope endpoint has to be present in UMA configuration to make it discoverable.

The `ldif` for both an internal and external scope is given below:

**Sample ldif**
```
dn: inum=@!1111!8990!BF80,ou=scopes,ou=uma,o=@!1111,o=gluu
displayName: View
inum: @!1111!8990!BF80
objectClass: oxAuthUmaScopeDescription
objectClass: top
oxId: View
oxIconUrl: http://<hostname>/uma/icons/view_scope.png
```

### Add Scopes
This section describes the process of adding UMA scopes in the Gluu Server GUI. Scopes are accessed by navigating to the `UMA` > `Scopes` in the right hand menu.

![uma-scopes](../img/uma/uma-scopes.png)

The search bar can be used to find existing available scopes. New scopes can be added by clicking on the `Add Scope` button which will bring up the interface shown below:

![uma-scopes](../img/uma/scopes-add.png)

Additionally there is an option to add authorization policy with the new scope.


## Resource Registration
Resources protected by UMA 2 must be registered in oxTrust by navigating to `UMA` > `Resources` or via [UMA-API](../api-guide/uma-api.md). . 

![uma-resources](../img/uma/uma-resources.png)

The search bar can be used to find existing available resources. New resources can be added by clicking on the `Add Resource Set` button, which will bring up the interface shown below:

![uma-resources](../img/uma/resources-add.png)

Resource access can be restricted by associated client with `umaRestrictResourceToAssociatedClient` oxauth configuration property. Associated client is array that is automatically populated with `clientDn` that creates it.  

## UMA RPT Authorization Policies
UMA RPT Authorization policy's are associated with UMA scopes. An authorization request has a resource_id and scope(s). Each scope can point to one or more policies. If all policies associated with all scopes return `true`, then access is granted. 

For example, let's say we have the following resource, `GET /photo`. In order to access it the Resource Server (RS) requires the `read` scope to be present. If we have a policy that always return `true`, then any authorization request to `/photo` that includes the `read` scope will result in access granted. 

If we wish to have more sophisticated logic, for example to grant access only to a specific client, then we can add something like `client_id = "@1111"` to the policy. This means that an authorization request to `/photo` will only be granted if the scope includes `read` and is coming from `client_id = "@1111"`.

There are three (3) main properties of a policy:

1. scopes: policy protects resources by scopes; 
2. authorization script: script that is evaluated in order to grant/deny access; 
3. name: a human readable name to the UMA policy.

The following section outlines how to define UMA RPT Authorization policies from the Custom Script menu. The Custom Script page is accessed by navigating to `Configuration` > `Custom Scripts` > `UMA RPT Policies`.

![auth-policy](../img/uma/auth-policy.png)

Sample script
```
# Call sequence
# 1. First is call constructor of the Script __init__
# 2. Next init() method
# 3. Next getRequiredClaims() - method returns required claims, so UMA engine checks whether
#    in request RP provided all claims that are required. Pay attention that there can be
#    multiple scripts bound to the scopes, means that UMA engine will build set of required claims
#    from all scripts. If not all claims are provided need_info error is sent to RP.
#    During need_info construction getClaimsGatheringScriptName() method is called
# 4. authorize() method is called if all required claims are provided.
# 5. destroy()

```

### UMA 2 Claims-Gathering

Sometimes RPT Authorization Policy may require additional claims that has to be provided by the user. In this case Claims-Gathering Flow can be used to gather such information. The logic is coded as custom script and can be added by navigating to `Configuration` > `Custom Scripts` > `UMA Claims-Gathering`.

### UMA 2 RPT Authorization Policy Algorithm
The UMA 2 policy algorithm has two rules that must be followed:

1. UMA policies protect resources based on scopes. If a scope is protected by a policy, then the policy script must reutrn `true` in order to authorize access during RPT authorization.

2. Multiple policies can protect a single scope. In such a case, all the policies must retun `true` to authorize access or else access will be denied.

![policy-algorithm](../img/uma/policy-algorithm.jpg) 

### UMA 2 Client Authentication

UMA 2 is regular OAuth 2 Token Endpoint. Therefore it support all client authentications then in regular OAuth2/OpenID Connect.

However there is one special client authentication method which is using `access_token` obtained by user to authenticated the client. Means client that was used during user authentication is used for client authentication. Of course `access_token` must be valid.

Non-normative example

```json
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: AccessToken czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
...
```


## Scopes Expressions

UMA 2 Scope expressions is Gluu invented extension of UMA 2 which gives flexible way to 
combine scopes and thus propose more robust way to grant access.

### Register resource with scope_expression

RS registers resource 

!!! Note
        new `scope_expression` field, `resource_scopes` is ignored in this case

```json
{  
   "resource_scopes":[],
   "description":"Collection of digital photographs",
   "icon_uri":"http://www.example.com/icons/flower.png",
   "name":"Photo Album",
   "type":"http://www.example.com/rsrcs/photoalbum",
   "scope_expression": {
      "rule": {
         "and": [
            {
               "or": [
                   {"var": 0},
                   {"var": 1}
               ]
            },
            {"var": 2}
         ]
      },
      "data": [
         "http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/all",
         "http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/add",
         "http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/internalClient"
      ]
   }
}

```

### Spontaneous scopes 

Sometimes it's required to handle scope by pattern. For example we wish to grant access for particular user based on path
```
/user/1
...
/user/n
```
In this case we can't register resources for each user since it is dynamic. If lets say we have 1 million users we don't want to register 1 million resources.
It can be handled with spontaneous scopes which works via regular expressions.

1. Allow spontaneous scopes for client via `allow_spontaneous_scopes` client property.
2. Register resource with scope `^/user/.+$`
3. Register and assign UMA RPT Authorization Policies to `^/user/.+$` 
4. RS should sent explicit scope in permission during ticket registration, e.g. `/user/1` (AS validates whether `/user/1` matches regexp `^/user/.+$`). After validation AS persists `/user/1` scope and during RPT creation puts permission with explicit scope.

In this way AS can validate and persist scopes dynamically. Spontaneous scopes have lifetime which is controlled by `spontaneousScopeLifetime` global oxauth configuration property.

### Ticket registration

RS registers tickets with all scopes mentioned in "data" (we need all scopes in order to evaluate expression, all or nothing principle)

```json

{  
   "resource_id":"112210f47de98100",
   "resource_scopes":[  
       "http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/all",
       "http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/add",
       "http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/internalClient"
   ]
}
```

### Evaluation

UMA Engine iterates over each scope and fetch ALL policies for each scope. Evaluates all policies.
a) not enough claims - return need_info error
b) enough claims - evaluate results from ALL policies with "AND" rule for ONE given scope.
   b1) `http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/all` -  `policyA AND policyB` => false
   b2) `http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/add` -  `policyA AND policyD` => true
   b3) `http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/internalClient` - `policyD AND policyE and policyK` => true

Results in expression : `(false OR true) AND true` => `true`

Below is example of including all scopes except `http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/all` scope (because for this part of expression `false` is returned). 

```json
{  
   "active":true,
   "exp":1256953732,
   "iat":1256912345,
   "permissions":[  
      {  
         "resource_id":"112210f47de98100",
         "resource_scopes":[  
            "http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/add",
            "http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/internalClient"
         ],
         "exp":1256953732
      }
   ]
}
```

## RPT as JWT

By default RPT is plain bearer token. It is possible to return RPT as signed JWT. It is configurable via `rpt_as_jwt` boolean client property. Signed RPT JWT contains:

- `pct_claims` - list of PCT claims
- `permissions` - list of permissions for given RPT
- `exp` - expiration date in seconds
- `iat` - creation date in seconds
- `iss` - issuer
- `aud` - audience
- `client_id` - client id

Please note that it is not possible to update existing RPT at Token Endpoint if `rpt_as_jwt=true` for client since JWT has to be re-generated to encode new permissions. Therefore RPT as JWT is generated if existing RPT is not provided (at `rpt` request parameter) during requesting RPT at Token Endpoint. 

RPT as JWT is signed with algorithm set by `access_token_signing_alg` client property or otherwise if it is not set then by `defaultSignatureAlgorithm` oxauth configuration property. 

Example of decoded JWT payload claims:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://myop.gluu.org",
  "aud": "@!DBE5.84F8.631A.9172!0001!CD07.49BE!0008!AB77!1A2B",
  "client_id": "@!DBE5.84F8.631A.9172!0001!CD07.49BE!0008!AB77!1A2B",
  "exp": 1544112457,
  "iat": 1544108857,
  "pct_claims": {
    "country": "US",
    "city": "NY"
  },
  "permissions": [
    {
      "resource_id": "eb2591de-db07-498d-860a-b7c223be302e",
      "resource_scopes": [
        "http://photoz.example.com/dev/scopes/view"
      ],
      "exp": 1544112448,
      "params": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## FAQ

### Pass parameters (request URL, HTTP Method etc) from RS to AS and use in interception script.

Sometime it can be useful to pass to RPT Authorization script additional parameters. RS can do it via `params` field during ticket registration at Permission Endpoint.

```
POST /perm HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: as.example.com
Authorization: Bearer 204c69636b6c69

{  
   "resource_id":"112210f47de98100",
   "resource_scopes":[  
       "view",
       "http://photoz.example.com/dev/actions/print"
   ],
   "params":{
       "url":"https://rs.example.com/policy/123456?action=read&subject=09876"
       "method":"GET"
   }   
}
```

Then in RPT Authorization script to get `url` following code can be used `context.getPermissions().get(0).getAttributes().get("url")`
