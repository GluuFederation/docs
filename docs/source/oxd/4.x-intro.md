### What's New

#### RESTful (https)
oxd 3.1.1 includes a new component called the `oxd-https-extension`. The extension is included out-of-the-box in the oxd Linux packages--it simply needs to be started. With the `oxd-https-extension`, applications can make RESTful calls to your oxd server over the web.

#### UMA 2.0
Gluu Server and oxd 3.1.1 are the first commercially supported IAM server and clients to implement the UMA 2.0 [Grant for OAuth 2.0 Authorization](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/oauth-uma-grant-2.0-05.html) and [Federated Authorization](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-federated-authz-2.0.html) specifications. UMA 2.0 now aligns completely with OAuth 2.0. It also re-defines the claims gathering flow, enabling developers to implement multi-step consent, user-interactions, and stepped-up authentication flows. 

#### Caching
oxd 3.1.1 now supports in-memory or redis caching of data to improve throughput for OpenID Connect and UMA clients.

#### Easy Upgrades
oxd 3.1.1 includes an auto-migration process to transfer your existing oxd JSON files to your new oxd 3.1.1 server(s).

### Legacy Compatibility

- UMA 2.0: Supported in oxd 3.1.2 and Gluu Server 3.1.1    

- UMA 1.0.1: Not supported in oxd 3.1.1or Gluu Server 3.1.1

- OpenID Connect: Supported in all versions of oxd and Gluu Server   

- Pricing: If you upgrade existing oxd installations to oxd 3.1.1, the new per application billing model described above will take effect. This could have an impact on your monthly bill
